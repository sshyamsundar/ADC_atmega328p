In Real world applications ever sensors which fetch data from surroundings is in analog format example( Temperature , Humidity, Moisture etc). So one has to read analog data's from the sensors. This tutorial deals with fetching data using ATMEGA328p AVR controller. Micro controller works only with digital values (i.e) 1's and 0's. So Analog to Digital Conversion(ADC) will be used before giving input to Micro controller.

In this project i will be switching LED based on the readings of analog values. I will let you know the features of ATMEGA328p

    10-bit successive approximation ADC
    0 - VCC ADC Input Voltage Range
    The minimum value represents GND and the maximum value represents the voltage on the AREF pin minus 1 LSB.
